# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-LAPD-Crime-Data

This repository contains the supporting materials for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) spanning from 2020 up to March 2025.

The primary goal of this EDA was to gain insights into crime patterns, trends, and characteristics within the LAPD jurisdiction over this period, utilizing the R programming language.
